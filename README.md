## Contentstack publishing script

Contentstack publishing script lets you publish auto publish your entries and assets depending upon the cases given below

- Publish the edits made in the entries on a particular environment

- Publish the assets of a stack
- Publish the entries of a stack
- Publish the entries when a non-localized field is changed
- Update and publish the entries when a new field is added to a content type

#### Install dependencies:

Before we dive into the use cases, let's ensure that we install the required dependencies and make changes in the configuration files which will remain common for all uses cases that we have discussed

```sh
$ npm install 
```
#### Specify Stack details in config file(config/index.ssssjs)
```sh
$ module.exports = {
	apikey:'',
	access_token:'',
	apiEndPoint:'https://api.contentstack.io',
	cdnEndPoint:'https://cdn.contentstack.io',
	authToken:'',
	manageToken:'',
}
```

### Cases

#### Case 1) Publish edits on entries made on particular environment

```sh
$ module.exports = {
		publish_edits_on_env:{
		contentTypes:['test'], // array of contentTypes where edits needs to be checked
		sourceEnv : 'production', //environment where entry edits needs to be checked
		publishEnvironments:['production'], //publishing environment(usually same as source Env)
		locales:['en-us',] // locales of entries where it needs to be checked

		}
	}
}  
```

#### Retrying failed Entries 
entries which failed to publish are stored in logs directory with unique name. In order to retry entries of those log file, you need execute same script with **retryFailed** flag along with **${logFilename}** which follows after it
```sh
$ npm run publish_entries -- -retryFailed ${logFilename} 
```
for example
//npm run pubish_entries -- -retryFailed 2777bulkPublishAssets
